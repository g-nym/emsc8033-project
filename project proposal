# EMSC4033 project plan template

## Project title

## Executive summary

In one to two sentences, explain the background, the broad goals of the project and what the specific outcomes will be.

Dynamical systems modelling is a common tool in climate and ocean geosciences, and idealised models provide insight and test theories that form the basis of larger realistic models. After writing the system of equations, tuning the variables is a crucial and potentially cumbersome processes. This piece of code aims to take an input of equations and variables, run the model across a range of potential values, and return a range for variable tuning with some relevant feedback.

## Goals

- Write a function that takes a system of dynamical equations and finds a range or potential solutions for the variables.
- Return the range of possible variable values in a useful, meaningful way
- Would it be possible/feasible to constrain the desired value output by comparison to an existing timeseries? i.e. finding the variables that are closest to a timeseries of observed data?


## Background and Innovation  

_Give more details on the scientific problem that you are working on and how this project will advance the discipline or help with your own research.
(Where applicable, describe how people have been achieving this goal up to now, talk about existing packages, their limitations, whether you can generalise something to help other people use your code)._

## Resources & Timeline

_What do you have at your disposal already that will help the project along. Did you convince somebody else to help you ? Are there already some packages you can build upon. What makes it possible to do this project in the time available. Do you intend to continue this project in the future ?_

(For example:
  - I’ll be using data of X from satellite and then also data from baby blue seals…
  - I’ll step on existing package Y and build extra functionality on top of class W.
  - I’ll use textbook Z that describes algorithms a, b, c
  - …
)

## Testing, validation, documentation

**Note:** You need to think about how you will know your code is correct and achieves the goals that are set out above (specific tests that can be implemented automatically using, for example, the `assert` statement in python.)  It can be really helpful if those tests are also part of the documentation so that when you tell people how to do something with the code, the example you give is specifically targetted by some test code.

_Provide some specific tests with values that you can imagine `assert`ing_
